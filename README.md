# EDGAR‚ÄëEdge

**Streaming NLP Factor Engine for 8‚ÄëK / 10‚ÄëK Filings**

> A production‚Äëgrade pipeline that ingests SEC filings in near‚Äëreal‚Äëtime, runs fast sentiment inference with a fine‚Äëtuned DistilRoBERTa model, constructs a z‚Äëscored daily sentiment factor, and backs it against SPX sectors‚Äîall hosted with Terraform, Docker, and AWS serverless infrastructure.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Highlights

- **Latency & Throughput**: < 60¬†s ingest from SEC ‚Üí S3, p95 inference < 200¬†ms on t4g.small, sustain 300 filings/hr
- **Signal Quality**: 6‚Äëmo IC ‚â• 0.05 (t‚Äëstat ‚â• 3), transaction‚Äëcost‚Äëadjusted Sharpe > 1
- **Engineering Depth**: AWS Lambda + SQS + Fargate + Terraform + GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Research Rigor**: walk‚Äëforward validation, sector/beta neutralisation, bootstrap CIs, regime stress tests
- **Presentation**: public Streamlit dashboard, PDF white‚Äëpaper, 2‚Äëmin demo video

## üèÅ Quickstart
> (live demo to come. So far this quickstart just allows you to deploy the infrastructure on AWS and pull the SEC filings from the EDGAR RSS feed into an s3 bucket in real-time. - JHM, 2025-04-27)

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Account** with permissions to create: S3, Lambda, SQS, Fargate, IAM, CloudWatch
- **Terraform v1.4+**
- **Docker**
- **Poetry** or **pipenv** for Python dependencies

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackharrisonmohr/EDGAR-edge
cd EDGAR-edge
```

### 2. Configure AWS credentials

```bash
aws-vault exec myprofile -- terraform init infra/
```

Or export via environment:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

### 3. Provision infrastructure

```bash
cd infra
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### 4. Package & deploy the ingest Lambda

```bash
make lambda-package            # builds ingest zip
terraform apply -auto-approve # picks up new lambda code
```

### 5. Run the demo

```bash
# Ingest PoC: monitor S3 bucket for new `raw/` objects
aws s3 ls s3://edgar-edge-raw/ --recursive | tail -n 10

# View latency metrics in CloudWatch Logs Insights
```

## üéâ Milestone 1: Real-time Ingest Pipeline (Completed Week 1)

Successfully established the foundational real-time data ingestion pipeline, achieving the goal of landing raw SEC filings in an S3 bucket within 60 seconds of their publication on the EDGAR RSS feed.

**Key Achievements:**

- **Infrastructure Setup:** Provisioned core AWS resources (S3 buckets for raw data and logs, IAM execution role, CloudWatch log group) using Terraform (`infra/`).
- **SEC Feed Integration:** Developed and tested a Python script (`src/ingest/rss_poc.py`) to parse the EDGAR 8-K RSS feed.
- **Lambda Puller:** Deployed an AWS Lambda function (`src/ingest/handler.py`) triggered every minute by EventBridge to poll the RSS feed and write new filing metadata to the `edgar-edge-raw` S3 bucket.
- **Latency Measurement:** Instrumented the Lambda function to calculate and log the ingest latency (`LAG_SECS`) from SEC publication time to S3 write time.
- **Verification:** Confirmed end-to-end functionality through smoke tests, verifying timely object creation in S3 and monitoring latency via CloudWatch Logs Insights, achieving `p50 lag < 60s`.
- **CI/CD Foundation:** Implemented a basic GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for automated testing, code formatting checks, Lambda packaging, and Terraform deployment on pushes to `main`.
- **Development Environment:** Set up the project structure, configured `pyproject.toml` with Poetry for dependency management, and integrated development tools (`black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `pytest`, `moto`, `pre-commit`).

This milestone provides the reliable, low-latency data source required for the subsequent stages of the project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Secrets

- All **non‚Äësensitive** variables live in `infra/vars.tf` with sensible defaults.
- **Sensitive** values (AWS creds, vendor API keys) are loaded at runtime via:
  - GitHub Actions **Repository Secrets**
  - AWS **Secrets Manager** (pulled by Terraform)
- Provide your own `.tfvars` (see `terraform.tfvars.example`).

---

## üìä Monitoring & Testing

- **CloudWatch**: ingest lag, SQS age, Lambda errors
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: inference latency histogram on Fargate
- **CD pipeline**: GitHub Actions runs `pytest`, `black --check`, `terraform fmt` on every push
